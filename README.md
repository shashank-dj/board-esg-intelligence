# Board ESG Intelligence 🌱  
### Board-Level ESG Decision Intelligence for Private Equity & Directors

---

## Overview

**Board ESG Intelligence** is a governance-focused web application designed for **Private Equity firms, Boards of Directors, and portfolio companies** to systematically **document, validate, and evidence ESG-related decisions** made at board level.

The platform addresses a critical gap in modern ESG practice: while ESG considerations are increasingly discussed in boardrooms, they are rarely captured in a **structured, defensible, and auditable way**.

Board ESG Intelligence provides a **system of record for ESG governance** — not ESG reporting.

---

## The Problem

Regulators, Limited Partners (LPs), and buyers are no longer satisfied with:
- ESG policies
- Sustainability reports
- High-level commitments

They now ask:

> *“How were ESG risks considered at board level?”*

In reality, most organizations rely on:
- Fragmented board minutes
- Email threads
- Personal recollection
- Inconsistent documentation

This creates governance risk, weak defensibility, and painful LP or audit reviews.

---

## The Solution

Board ESG Intelligence enables boards and PE firms to:

- Capture ESG-relevant board decisions in a **structured, auditable format**
- Maintain **defensible evidence** of ESG diligence
- Improve governance consistency across portfolio companies
- Respond confidently to LP reviews, regulatory scrutiny, and exit due diligence
